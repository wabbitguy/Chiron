These profiles are based on a lot of hours of testing various filament brands
and nozzle sizes on the AnyCubic Chiron.

They were created with PRUSA Slicer 2.3.3 and updated for Slicer 2.4.0

Marlin firmware for the Chiron for these tests is 1.3.0 from the master
branch.

What I have found that is unusual is that PETG prints out with lower
temperatures than what I am used to. Normally 230C range is used for PETG but
with the Chiron and the larger nozzles I have found that I could hear the
filament actually bubbling inside the nozzle. To achieve the best finish and
proper extrusion, I have been printing at 206C. No nozzle clogs or extruder
skipping.

If you find that this temperature is too low, bump it up by 5C and repeat a test
print. That should be the only change you'd have to make to the profiles in order
to successfully use them.
